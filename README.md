Crime Analysis and Reporting System is a Python-based application designed to manage and analyze crime-related data such as incidents, statuses, and case reports. The system follows an object-oriented architecture and uses SQL as the backend for persistent data storage. It enables users to create and update crime incidents, track their statuses, generate detailed reports, and manage cases that may involve multiple incidents. Built with modularity in mind, the project is organized into multiple packages: entity for model classes like Incident, Case, and Status; dao for service interfaces and their implementations; util for database connection and property utilities; myexceptions for custom exception handling; and main which contains the entry point of the application. The project includes exception handling to ensure smooth execution and robustness, especially when dealing with invalid inputs. Unit tests have been incorporated to validate the core service functionalities and ensure system reliability. The system is developed using Python, connected to a MySQL database using the mysql-connector-python library, and built using PyCharm IDE.
